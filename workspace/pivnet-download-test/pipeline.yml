# Pipelines use "resources" to interact with the outside world.
# There are a number of built-in resources, and Concourse can
# be extended by adding additional resource types.

# We need to fetch files from PivNet, so need to add a resource
# type that can interact with it.
#
# This pipeline uses that resource to fetch a file from PivNet to
# validate access.
